# Port analysis

What `speed.exe` needs from the kit, measured on 2026-09-13 from the pinned
executable. This is the `analyze` stage of the kit's design (its section 3.2)
done by hand, since the kit's `analyze` command is milestone M2 work.
Keep this file true as the bring-up moves.

## The executable

| | |
| --- | --- |
| File | `speed.exe`, 6,029,312 bytes |
| SHA-256 | `80774c2e5d619b4f120b48d4462896fd504c263399d203a238769cffde1d253c` |
| Linker | Microsoft 7.10 (Visual C++ .NET 2003), link timestamp 2005-12-01 |
| Image base, entry point | `0x00400000`, `0x007c4040` |
| Sections | `.text` 4.6 MB code, `.rdata`, `.data` (0xdce10 bytes, 0xb8e10 of them uninitialised), `.rsrc`, and one unnamed discardable section |
| Relocations, TLS | none, none: the image loads at its preferred base only |
| Packing, protection | none found: section entropy is that of plain code and data, and no SafeDisc or SecuROM markers are present. The retail disc check is absent from this build. |
| Version resource | none; the patch level is not recorded in the file |

The unnamed fifth section (`0x00a38000`, 0x40e4e bytes) is data the game
references; the page of zero padding before it, after `.rsrc` ends at
`0x00a3764e`, is where `game.toml` parks its unidentified hooks.

## Import surface

300 imports across 14 DLLs. Measured against the shims registered in kit
`main` at 4574a35 (2026-09-14): 163 of 300 have a shim. Buckets follow the
kit design's implemented / auto-stub / unsupported split.

| DLL | Shimmed | Bucket | What is missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `KERNEL32` | 115 / 157 | implemented, partly | toolhelp snapshots, priority and affinity, `IsDebuggerPresent`, `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`, file-time conversion, the serial `*Comm*` family, `CreateProcessA`, waitable timers, `QueueUserAPC`, `VirtualProtect`, `VirtualQuery`, `SleepEx`, `DuplicateHandle`, `TerminateThread`, date and time formatting |
| `USER32` | 30 / 41 | implemented, partly | `SetCapture`, `ReleaseCapture`, `RegisterClassExA`, `AdjustWindowRect`, `GetDesktopWindow`, `MapVirtualKeyA`, `MapVirtualKeyExA`, `ToUnicode`, `SendInput`, `PostThreadMessageA`, `wsprintfA` |
| `GDI32` | 8 / 12 | auto-stub | `CreateFontA`, `ExtTextOutA`, `CreateBitmap`, `GetPixel`: text rendered into a bitmap, likely the debug text path |
| `ADVAPI32` | 5 / 6 | implemented | `RegCreateKeyA`; the game keeps settings, CD key and language in the registry |
| `SHELL32`, `SHFOLDER` | 1 / 1, 0 / 1 | implemented, auto-stub | `SHGetFolderPathA` for the profile directory |
| `d3d9` | 0 / 1 | **unsupported** | `Direct3DCreate9` |
| `d3dx9_26` | 0 / 13 | **unsupported** | `D3DXCreateEffectFromResourceA`, `D3DXCreateEffectPool` and eleven matrix and vector helpers |
| `DINPUT8` | 0 / 1 | unsupported today | `DirectInput8Create`; the kit shims the `DINPUT.dll` generation |
| `DSOUND` | 1 / 2 | partly | ordinal 6 `DirectSoundCaptureCreate` (voice chat) needs a stub |
| `WINMM` | 3 / 24 | unsupported today | the kit has the timer family; every `waveOut*` and `waveIn*` streaming call is missing |
| `WS2_32` | 0 / 31 | auto-stub, fail cleanly | online play; the kit shims `WSOCK32.dll`, not `WS2_32.dll` |
| `TAPI32` | 0 / 9 | auto-stub, fail cleanly | modem play |
| `NETAPI32` | 0 / 1 | auto-stub | `Netbios` |

The loader has no auto-stub generator yet (kit milestone M2): an import
with no shim is what the first boot's run report will list.

## Graphics: the blocking item

The game renders with Direct3D 9 through D3DX effects. Thirty-one `.fx`
effects are compiled into the executable as RCDATA resources
(`IDI_WORLD_FX`, `IDI_CAR_FX`, `IDI_SKYBOX_FX`, `IDI_SHADOW_MAP_MESH_FX`,
`IDI_VISUALTREATMENT_FX`, `IDI_PARTICLES_FX`, `IDI_RAIN_DROP_FX`, …) and
loaded with `D3DXCreateEffectFromResourceA`; the effect text names shader
profiles `vs_1_1`, `ps_1_1`, `ps_1_4` and `ps_2_0`. Every draw goes through
`IDirect3DDevice9` with vertex and pixel shaders bound by the effect
framework.

The kit's `dx/` models DirectDraw through version 4 and fixed-function
Direct3D 2; its design lists shader-model Direct3D 8 and 9 as a non-goal for
the first version and fixed-function Direct3D 8 and 9 as milestone M5.
Bringing this game up therefore needs, in the kit:

1. `IDirect3D9` and `IDirect3DDevice9` shims: device, swap chain, textures,
   vertex and index buffers, declarations, render states, render targets and
   depth-stencil surfaces (the game's shadow maps use `D24S8`).
2. A D3DX effect shim: parse the compiled effect (the `.fx` resources are
   text, so a compiler or a hand translation per effect), map techniques and
   passes to Metal pipeline states, and expose the parameter table the game
   sets by handle.
3. Shader translation: the profiles are simple enough (SM 1.1 to 2.0) that a
   per-effect Metal Shading Language port is feasible; 31 effects is a bounded
   amount of work, and the kit's Metal backend already has the presentation
   and texture plumbing.

Nothing in the runtime, loader or translator is affected by this; it is
host and `dx/` work.

## Audio, input, time

- Audio streams through `waveOutWrite` (24 winmm imports) and DirectSound;
  the SDL3 audio sink behind the kit's mixer can back a waveOut shim.
  `SOUND/` is 918 MB of EA's own formats, decoded by the game itself.
- `DirectInput8Create` gives the game keyboard, mouse and gamepad state;
  the kit's input gate and touch mapper attach to a DirectInput device
  object, whose vtable `game.toml` currently names with a sentinel.
- `timeGetTime` and `timeBeginPeriod` are the game's clock, not
  `GetTickCount` alone; the kit's frame-clock hook identifies the draw-loop
  waits by `GetTickCount` return addresses. Whether the game's frame limiter
  is reachable through that hook, or needs a `timeGetTime` hook in the kit,
  is a question for the listings.
- Cinematics are 856 MB of VP6 video under `MOVIES/` (32 files), decoded by
  the game's own code, not by a Bink DLL. Nothing to shim; they are excluded
  from the iOS bundle until playback is proven.

## Data

| Directory | Size | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SOUND` | 918 MB | engine, speech, streams, music |
| `MOVIES` | 856 MB | VP6 cinematics, excluded from bundles |
| `TRACKS` | 609 MB | the city and its streams |
| `CARS` | 373 MB | geometry, textures, vinyls per car |
| `FRONTEND`, `GLOBAL`, `NIS`, `LANGUAGES` | 154 MB | UI, shared bundles, scripted scenes, text |

Paths inside the executable use the game directory relative to
`guest_root`, with mixed case (`TRACKS\L2RA\TrackMaps.bin`, `frontend.bin`,
`GLOBAL\GlobalMemoryFile.bin`); the kit's case-folded path index handles
that. Saves go under the profile directory `SHGetFolderPathA` returns.

## Modules that are not the game

| File | What it is | Fate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dinput8.dll` | a 2023 ASI loader (1,180 exports, its own `Direct3DCreate9` import) | not part of the port |
| `scripts/NFSMostWanted.WidescreenFix.asi` and `.ini` | the widescreen fix: resolution, HUD and FOV correction, windowed mode, sim rate, shadow resolution | not loaded; its behaviours become native host options |
| `server.dll` | the LAN server (`StartServer`, `StopServer`, `IsServerRunning`) | not loaded; multiplayer is out of scope |
| `FirewallInstallHelper.dll`, `GameuxInstallHelper.dll`, `*_inst.exe` | installer helpers | excluded |

## Translation

The kit's translator reads Ghidra listings and emits one C function per
original function. `tools/analyze.py` exports them with Ghidra's default
analyzers (`analysis/decompiled/speed.exe/summary.txt` gives the count).
The translator's own coverage report, `build/recomp/translate-report.json`,
is the record of unsupported instructions and unresolved indirect targets;
see the section below once a run has been recorded.

### Run log

Recorded runs of the pipeline against this executable, newest first.

#### 2026-09-17: what a rasterizer would draw, and why it would still be black

The draw path now decodes each vertex declaration and prints the vertices.
The seven opening draws are three kinds of quad:

| Draws | Layout | Where | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 | `POSITION` float3, `COLOR`, four `TEXCOORD` pairs with sub-texel offsets | 160x120 off-screen targets | a separable filter chain: blur or downsample |
| 6 | `POSITION` float4, one `TEXCOORD` | the back buffer, full screen | the final composite |
| 7 | `POSITION` float3, `COLOR` `0x80808080`, one `TEXCOORD` | the back buffer, a 16x32-pixel corner | a small textured indicator |

All positions are in clip space, from -1 to 1, so the effects' vertex stages
pass them through and a viewport transform is all a rasterizer needs for
these. That part would be easy.

It would not produce a picture. Every target those passes read was cleared to
black and no scene has been drawn into any of them, so the filter chain and
the composite are black in, black out. Only draw 7 could light pixels, and
its texture, like every texture in these draws, is bound through
`ID3DXEffect::SetTexture`. The effect is accepted without being parsed, so
the device has no idea what is bound: every draw reports texture 0.

This settles the order of the remaining work, and it is not the order a
quick look suggested. A quad filler first would show, at best, a grey square
in a corner. The first real image needs:

1. the compiled effect format parsed, so parameters, techniques, passes,
   sampler bindings and render states are known;
2. `SetTexture`, `SetMatrix` and the rest of the parameter calls recorded
   against those parameters;
3. each pass's vertex and pixel shader bytecode translated and executed,
   on Metal or on the CPU;
4. the world itself, which the game has not started drawing in this part of
   the run.

That is the large piece this port was always going to need, and it is now the
only piece left in front of a picture.

#### 2026-09-17: the first presented frames, and why they are black

The presenter now accepts 32-bit frames, and the Direct3D 9 device clears,
copies and presents for real. Two frames reach the host and the frame dump
writes both. Both are black, and the run says that is correct:

```text
clear 1:  flags 7 colour 00000000, the back buffer
present:  back buffer, 0 of 3168 sampled pixels lit
clear 2-7:  colour 00000000, off-screen targets of 640x480, 160x120 and 20x15
clear 8-13: colour ff000000, six 16x16 targets
StretchRect: back buffer -> off-screen 640x480
draws 1-7:  seven screen-space quads
present:  back buffer, 0 of 3168 sampled pixels lit
```

Every clear is black. The one copy goes from the back buffer to an off-screen
target, which is a post-processing grab rather than a composition onto the
screen. So the only thing in these frames that would put a non-black pixel on
the back buffer is the seven quads, and nothing draws them yet.

This closes the question of the presentation path: it works, and a black
window is the honest output of the port as it stands. The first visible
image now depends entirely on rasterizing those quads, which needs the
vertex layouts decoded from the declarations, the bound textures sampled,
and the effect's pixel stage reproduced closely enough to give the right
colour.

#### 2026-09-16: what the draws contain

The draw entry points now report their arguments. Every draw in the opening
of the game is the same shape:

```text
draw 1: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 48-byte vertices inline at 0efff294
draw 2: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 48-byte vertices inline at 0efff290
draw 3: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 48-byte vertices inline at 0efff27c
draw 4: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 48-byte vertices inline at 0efff290
draw 5: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 48-byte vertices inline at 0efff27c
draw 6: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 24-byte vertices inline at 0efff368
draw 7: triangle fan, 2 primitives, 32-byte vertices inline at 0efffa10
```

Two primitives as a fan is four vertices: a quad. The addresses are in the
guest stack, so each quad is built as a local and handed to the call. Strides
of 48, 24 and 32 bytes are three different vertex layouts, which matches the
12 vertex declarations created earlier.

This says something useful about the order of the remaining work. These are
screen-space quads - a front end, a loading screen, a fade - not the world.
A first visible image therefore does not need the 31 compiled effects
translated to Metal. It needs a swap chain backed by a drawable, the render
target bound to it, one textured-quad pipeline, and the inline vertices
uploaded. The world, its shaders and its shadow cube can come afterwards.

That is the smallest honest next milestone: one quad on screen, drawn from
the game's own vertices and its own texture.

#### 2026-09-16: correction, the game is drawing

The previous entry says no draw call has been reached. That is wrong, and the
error was in how I counted rather than in the run. The census tested for
`DrawPrimitive` and `DrawIndexedPrimitive`; this game draws with
`DrawPrimitiveUP`, which matches neither test. Run 19 contains seven draw
calls, and they sit exactly where draws belong:

```text
ID3DXEffect::Begin          12
ID3DXEffect::BeginPass       7
ID3DXEffect::CommitChanges   7
IDirect3DDevice9::DrawPrimitiveUP   7
ID3DXEffect::EndPass         7
ID3DXEffect::End            12
```

`UP` means user pointer: the geometry is passed inline with the call rather
than from a bound vertex buffer, which is why `SetStreamSource` never appears
while `CreateVertexBuffer` and its locks do.

So the full shape of a frame is present: render target and depth surface
selected, viewport and transforms set, render states and texture stage states
applied, an effect technique begun, a pass begun, parameters committed,
geometry drawn, the pass and effect ended, and the frame presented. Fifty
`SetRenderState` calls, 26 render-target switches, 20 texture-stage settings
and 14 viewport changes say the same thing.

Nothing is unresolved and nothing is rasterized. The kit records these draws
and produces no pixels, so the window stays empty. What stands between here
and an image is the GPU work itself: a swap chain and render targets backed by
Metal textures, vertex and index data uploaded, and the shader programs the
effects carry translated to Metal. That is the large remaining piece, and it
is unchanged by today.

#### 2026-09-16: nothing unresolved

`IDirect3DTexture9::LockRect` takes five dwords with `this` and the cube form
six; both were declared one short. The game locks a texture, copies pixels in
with `rep movsd`, and unlocks it by reloading the texture pointer from the
stack - so the missing pop moved that slot and the unlock called through zero.

The run after the correction is the cleanest of the bring-up:

| | Run 18 | Run 19 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| calls into nothing | 1 | **0** |
| `LockRect` / `UnlockRect` | 2 / 1 | 330 / 330 |
| textures created | 13 | 145 |
| `SetTexture` | 0 | 33 |
| `SetVertexDeclaration` | 0 | 12 |
| `Clear` | 7 | 14 |
| frames presented | 1 | 2 |
| draw calls | 0 | 0 |
| log lines | 3,142 | 8,095 |

Every guest call now reaches something that answers it. The game uploads its
texture set, binds textures, describes vertex formats, clears its targets and
presents frames. It has not issued a draw.

Three of the last four defects were the same mistake in different places: a
vtable slot declaring fewer arguments than it takes. The pop count is part of
the interface, and getting it wrong corrupts the caller rather than the
callee, which is why each one surfaced as a crash or a null call somewhere
unrelated.

#### 2026-09-16: six cube faces, and two runs that proved nothing

The cube texture was still being thrown away after one face. The reason was
mine and it is a COM rule: `GetCubeMapSurface` and `GetSurfaceLevel` hand out
a view **into** a texture, and taking one references the texture. The game
does the ordinary thing - take face zero, release the cube, keep using the
cube for the other five faces - and my standalone surfaces held no reference,
so that release destroyed it and face one was fetched through a dead pointer.
Views now reference their container and record it, so `GetContainer` answers
too. The game walks all six faces.

| | Run 15 | Run 18 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GetCubeMapSurface` | 1 | 6 |
| `IDirect3DCubeTexture9::Release` | 1 | 6 |
| calls into nothing | 1 | 1, and in a different place |
| draw calls | 0 | 0 |

Runs 16 and 17 are worth recording because they proved nothing and looked as
though they did. In the first, the edit script hit a failed assertion and
exited before writing, so the build compiled and ran unmodified code. In the
second, an anchor matched the wrong function, the compile failed, and the run
executed the previous binary. Both printed a plausible census, and both
reported success at the level of exit codes. A run only means something if
the change is verifiably in the binary that produced it.

The surviving call into nothing has moved, which is the point of fixing these
one at a time: it used to be in the cube loop and is now in the texture upload
path, right after `CreateTexture` and `IDirect3DTexture9::LockRect`.

#### 2026-09-16: what the game actually asks for, counted

A verbose run (`RECOMP_LOG=2`) for forty seconds, with no crash in it, made
148 distinct guest API calls. The graphics half of that census is the clearest
statement of where this port is:

| Call | Times | What it says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `D3DXCreateEffectFromResourceA` | 62 | it loads every effect it has |
| `ID3DXEffect::GetDesc` | 93 | and inspects each one |
| `SetTechnique`, `ValidateTechnique`, `OnLostDevice`, `Release` | 31 each | it picks a technique per effect, then discards half of them |
| `CreateVertexDeclaration` | 33 | it describes 33 vertex layouts |
| `CreateTexture` | 13 | and starts filling textures |
| `IDirect3DTexture9::LockRect` / `UnlockRect` | 2 / 1 | uploading image data |
| `CreateDepthStencilSurface` | 8 | shadow and depth targets |
| `SetRenderTarget`, `SetDepthStencilSurface` | 6 each | it is switching render passes |
| `Clear` | 7 | clearing them |
| `BeginScene`, `EndScene`, `Present` | 1 each | one frame boundary reached |
| `CreateCubeTexture` | 2 | the shadow cube |
| `GetCubeMapSurface`, then `Release` | 1, 1 | it asked for a face, got nothing, and threw the cube away |

That last row was the remaining defect, and it is the same mistake as the
effect descriptors: a method that returns success without writing what the
caller asked for. `GetCubeMapSurface` is now real, each face a surface of its
own kept on the texture. `GetLevelCount` was worse than a stub - it returns a
count rather than an HRESULT, so returning `D3D_OK` told the game its textures
had no levels at all; it now returns 1. `GetLevelDesc` fills its structure.

No `DrawPrimitive` has been reached. The game is still setting up: it is
loading effects, describing vertex formats, allocating targets and clearing
them. A draw call is the next milestone, and pixels need the whole Metal path
behind it, which does not exist yet.

#### 2026-09-16: four pop counts, and a run with no crash in it

Run 11 died at `EIP=0` immediately after `IDirect3DDevice9::CreateTexture`.
The cause was mine and it was arithmetic: a vtable slot's argument count is
part of the interface, and four of mine were one short.

| Slot | Declared | Actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IDirect3DDevice9::CreateTexture` | 8 | 9 |
| `IDirect3DDevice9::CreateVolumeTexture` | 9 | 10 |
| `IDirect3DDevice9::ProcessVertices` | 6 | 7 |
| `ID3DXEffect::GetParameterBySemantic` | 4 | 3 |

Each call through one of them left four bytes on the guest stack, so the
caller returned into whatever followed. With the counts corrected, run 12 has
no SIGBUS in it at all: the game boots, creates its device and resources,
loads its effects, streams audio through 2,815 sink pulls without a single
late or starved buffer, and runs until it is stopped.

One call into nothing remains, the cube-texture global described above. It is
the next thing to chase, and it is a shim question rather than a translation
one. No draw call has been reached yet.

The whole effect vtable was audited against the SDK signatures afterwards;
the remaining seventy-odd slots are right.

#### 2026-09-16: device resources, and the last call into nothing

The device now creates what the game asks for: textures, cube textures,
surfaces, vertex and index buffers, vertex declarations and queries, each an
object over real guest memory, so a `Lock` hands back storage the game can
fill. The device keeps its own back buffer and depth buffer and answers
`GetBackBuffer` and `GetDepthStencilSurface` with them.

| Run | Calls into nothing | How it ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9, with resources | 3 | ran the full 90 seconds, stopped by hand |
| 10, plus two entry points | 1 | SIGBUS in a guest worker thread |

Two of the three were not graphics at all. A vtable slot call at `007ee9fe`
and a function-pointer call at `00823380` each named a `.text` address no
listing owned, the same case as the CRT helpers; naming them in
`[translate] entry_points` removed both.

The survivor is the interesting one, and it is mine. `FUN_006bd4b0` sets up
the game's shadow-map cube:

```text
CreateCubeTexture(device, edge, 1, 1, format, 0, &g_cube, 0)   device slot 25
  then, per face: g_cube->GetCubeMapSurface(face, 0, &g_faces[i])  slot 18
  and            CreateDepthStencilSurface(...)                    slot 29
```

The call returned success and `g_cube` stayed null, so the game called
`GetCubeMapSurface` through a null pointer. Guest address 0 is mapped, so
reading a vtable through it yields zero and the call goes to nothing rather
than faulting, which is why this looked like a missing translation. The cause
was in the shim: every creator reported `D3D_OK` whether or not the interface
view was actually made. They now report the failure instead, which is both
correct and the only way the game can take its own fallback path.

Run 10 got further than run 9 and died sooner, which is the normal shape of
this work: each fix moves the failure later.

#### 2026-09-16 (later still): the game runs

With the effect descriptions filled in, the game stopped hanging and simply
ran. It was stopped by hand after about three minutes; it had not crashed,
and it was using a full core.

What it did in that time:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Direct3D | created its device, cleared, presented, and asked for the resources it wants to draw with |
| Effects | loaded `IDI_WORLD_FX`, walked its parameters, validated a technique, set values on it |
| Sound | created DirectSound buffers and streamed them: 2,815 sink pulls, none late, none starved |
| Threads | guest worker threads reached the host and were serviced |

The resources it asks the device for, and does not get, are now a list rather
than a guess:

```text
CreateTexture            CreateCubeTexture        CreateVertexBuffer
CreateIndexBuffer        CreateVertexDeclaration  CreateDepthStencilSurface
CreateQuery              GetBackBuffer            GetDepthStencilSurface
SetRenderTarget          SetDepthStencilSurface
```

and from the effect: `SetInt`, `ValidateTechnique`, `GetAnnotationByName`,
`OnLostDevice`. The seven remaining "call to unknown target" lines are the
game calling methods on the interfaces those creators never returned.

**What this is and is not.** The game boots, runs, streams its audio and
drives its own render loop without crashing. It draws nothing: there is no
render target, no swap chain, no texture or buffer storage, and no shader
translation, so the window stays empty. Sound is real; the picture is not.

The next piece is device resources, which is ordinary work: textures, vertex
and index buffers, surfaces, and a swap chain wired to the kit's Metal
backend. After that comes the part that is not ordinary: translating the
game's compiled shader bytecode, about 120 programs across 31 effects, into
Metal. That remains the bulk of the port.

#### 2026-09-16 (later): the game creates a device and enters its render loop

Two new kit modules, both on the `nfsmw` branch.

`dx/d3d9.cpp` is Direct3D 9: the factory object, the adapter and format
queries a game makes before it commits to a device, and `CreateDevice`. The
device's vtable is complete and in interface order, since a guest calls these
by slot index, but only a few slots do anything; the rest report themselves
once and return `D3D_OK`. `dx/d3dx9.cpp` is D3DX 9: the matrix and vector
maths for real, an effect pool, and effect objects for the effects compiled
into the executable's resources.

What the game did with them, in one run:

| Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| asked for the library | `Direct3DCreate9(SDK 32)` returned an interface |
| created its device | `CreateDevice 640x480, window 00020004` |
| entered its render loop | `Clear`, then `Present` |
| started describing geometry | `CreateVertexDeclaration` |
| loaded its first effect | `IDI_WORLD_FX`, the world shader |
| walked the effect's parameters | `GetDesc`, `GetParameter`, `GetParameterDesc` |

It then hung. The descriptor methods returned success without filling the
structures they were handed, so the game read whatever was already in that
memory as its parameter and technique counts and iterated on it. The four
descriptors now zero their structures and report one technique of one pass
and no parameters, which keeps the game's own loops finite. The process had
to be killed; it was not a crash.

This is the furthest the port has run. The game is inside its rendering code,
asking for shader parameters by name. Nothing draws: no render target, no
swap chain, no shader translation, and the 31 compiled effects are accepted
without being parsed. Those are the next pieces, and they are the large ones.

#### 2026-09-16: the translation compiles and the game boots to the Direct3D 9 wall

Kit work on branch `nfsmw` of recomp-kit, cut from `main` 4574a35.

**Translator.** Seven gaps closed, and the whole executable now translates:

| Change | Why |
| --- | --- |
| MMX, SSE and SSE2 become a `recomp_unmodelled` trap | `recomp_cpuid` advertises none of them, so a guest that checks CPUID never runs one; the 30 MMX blitters and the CRT's SSE2 math are dead code behind `__sse2_available` at `0x009c5310` |
| the trap is tested before the string instructions | `MOVSD` and `CMPSD` name both a string instruction and an SSE2 scalar-double one, and only the operands tell them apart; the string emitter was silently claiming the SSE2 form |
| `XADD` and `CMPXCHG` | lock-prefixed atomics in the CRT's reference counting |
| `LAHF` | one CRT flag inspection |
| `FLDLN2`, `FLDL2E`, `FLDLG2`, `FLDL2T` | the x87 constant loads `exp` and `log` use |
| `FNSTENV` and `FLDENV` | the 28-byte x87 environment, masking exceptions as hardware does |
| `INT3` ends a block | MSVC pads between functions with it; a listing whose tail is a call Ghidra marks non-returning ran that padding into the next function |

The Unicorn differential in the kit earned its place immediately: it caught
`FLDL2E` written as log10(e) instead of log2(e).

All 25,768 functions now translate. The archive is 221 MB from 188 chunks,
and `build/SpeedRecomp.app` links.

**Entry points.** `007f0e13` jumps through a `.data` slot holding `007f10e8`,
a CRT helper Ghidra never listed. The translator's pointer scan only accepts
16-byte-aligned destinations and these are not, so `game.toml` names them in
`[translate] entry_points`. Relaxing the alignment rule instead would be
wrong: 8,344 dwords in this image point into `.text` at 4-byte alignment and
decode as instructions, nearly all of them coincidence.

**Runtime.** `GetModuleHandleA` now hands out a handle for a DLL the runtime
serves, instead of reporting it missing. The CRT's `__mtinit` asks for
kernel32, and a null handle made it skip the block that fills in its own TLS
function pointers, leaving it to call one that was still zero. Nineteen
kernel32 shims were added (system and file times, process id, handle
duplication, `SleepEx`, waitable timers, priority and affinity, toolhelp
reporting no processes, `IsDebuggerPresent`). Unshimmed imports across
`d3d9`, `d3dx9_26`, `DINPUT8`, `SHFOLDER`, `WINMM` wave, `WS2_32`,
`NETAPI32`, `USER32` and `GDI32` now declare their stdcall pop counts, so a
call the runtime answers with zero still leaves the guest stack where the
callee would have.

**Boot progression**, each line a run of the built app:

| Run | How far | Stopped at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | CRT entry | `__mtinit` calling a null `FlsAlloc` pointer |
| 2 | CRT complete, into the game's own start-up | the indirect jump to the unlisted CRT helper `007f10e8` |
| 3 | window class, window, `Direct3DCreate9`, `D3DXCreateEffectPool`, `D3DXCreateEffectFromResourceA` | `006c1527`, `call dword ptr [ecx + 0x38]`: a COM method on the `IDirect3D9` that `Direct3DCreate9` could not return |

That last line is the wall this port was always going to hit, and it is now
the only thing between the game and a frame. Everything before it works:
the loader, the CRT, the file system, the registry, the window, and the
game's own start-up code up to the point where it asks for a device.

**Two more runs the same day.** Declaring stdcall pop counts removed every
stack-drift warning (run 4: zero, against eleven in run 3), and the game got
as far as asking for its window. `RegisterClassExA` had no implementation, so
`CreateWindowExA` found no class and failed silently, and the game carried on
with no window at all; the kit now registers the Ex structure, and run 5
creates the window cleanly. Both runs then end the same way: `Direct3DCreate9`
returns zero, the game calls a method on the interface it did not get, and
what follows is garbage (`call to unknown target 7972656c` is four bytes of a
string read as a function pointer). The last abort is an indirect jump to zero
at `007e7d76`.

Nothing is left between the game and a frame except Direct3D 9 itself.

**Native suites** (`tools/test.py --native`): 13 of 15 pass. `runtime_tests`
and `host_tests` fail on expectations written for Populous (its entry point,
IAT slot count, `weanetr` data imports, `data\VCONFIG0.*`, its frame-clock
addresses) and on the DirectInput mouse clamp, which cannot work while
`mouse_vtable` is a sentinel. The checks added for the module-handle change
pass, and Populous's own binary still reports 433 checks and 0 failures.

**Next**, in order: `IDirect3D9` and `IDirect3DDevice9`, the D3DX effect
runtime, and Metal translations of the 31 compiled effects; then
`DirectInput8Create`; then `waveOut` streaming. The graphics layer is the
bulk of the remaining work and is unchanged in size by today.

#### 2026-09-16: kit main 4574a35 clears discovery; 40 functions need MMX, SSE2 and four rarer ops

Re-pinned the kit from the `game-dir-wip` snapshot to `main` at 4574a35
(2026-09-14), the commit the majesty, pharaoh and siege repositories pin.
Since the snapshot the kit landed the translator's non-returning calls,
`--allow-table-gaps` through `tools/build.py`, `[translate] entry_points`,
`[game] heap_base`, winmm timers, gdi32, advapi32, version, wsock32, Miles,
Bink through FFmpeg, DirectShow, and Android, Linux and Windows packaging.
The config test passes on the new schema; the import table above is
measured against this commit (163 of 300 imports shimmed).

`tools/build.py --regenerate --target gen --allow-table-gaps "..."` on the
same listings: the non-returning-call rule removes every fall-through
target of the previous run. Discovery now completes, the translator parses
all 25,768 functions and emits code for all but 40. Those 40 fail at the
instruction level, and the 73 literal dispatch targets the final gate still
reports are, with one exception, direct calls into them (`0x007c45f0`, the
`STMXCSR` routine, is called from 19 sites; `0x006e9020`, the `FLDLN2`
routine, from two). The exception is `fn_00666590` jumping to `0x00666583`,
an address one byte inside the listing's previous instruction.

| Instructions the translator lacks | Functions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MMX: `MOVQ`, `PXOR`, `MOVD`, `EMMS` on `MM0`-`MM7` | 30 | a block of blitters and converters around `0x00811000`-`0x00818000`, one `EMMS` at `0x007f9fc2` |
| SSE2: `MOVAPD`, `MOVLPD`, `PXOR` on `XMM` | 3 | the CRT's floating-point helpers at `0x007ce670`, `0x007ce719`, `0x008128fe` |
| `STMXCSR` | 3 | the CRT's floating-point control routines, `0x007c45f0` among them |
| x87 constants `FLDL2E`, `FLDLN2` | 2 | `exp` and `log` helpers |
| `FNSTENV`, `LAHF` | 2 | CRT floating-point exception and flag inspection |

So the translator gap for this game is small and bounded: an `MM` register
file with the four MMX moves and `PXOR`, `XMM` operands for two moves and
`PXOR`, `STMXCSR` (store the default control word), two x87 constant loads,
and `FNSTENV` and `LAHF`. No unmodelled mnemonic appears outside those
forty functions. The 20 undecoded jump-table sites are accepted for now
through `--allow-table-gaps`; their switch shapes still need the decoder.
The compile of the emitted code has not run yet, because the gate stops
the build before it stages `build/recomp/gen`.

Order of work from here, all of it in the kit:

1. Translator: the MMX and SSE2 forms above, `STMXCSR`, the two x87
   constants, `FNSTENV`, `LAHF`; then the MSVC 7.1 jump-table shapes at the
   20 accepted sites. Then compile the translation and size it.
2. Shims the boot path needs: `DirectInput8Create`, `SHGetFolderPathA`,
   `RegCreateKeyA`, the missing user32 window-class and capture calls, then
   the run report for the rest of kernel32; `WS2_32`, `TAPI32`, `NETAPI32`
   and DirectSound capture as clean failures.
3. winmm `waveOut` streaming over the kit's mixer.
4. Direct3D 9 and the D3DX effect shim, the Metal ports of the 31 effects.
   The kit's `siege-delphi` branch (2026-09-15) starts DXGI, Direct3D 11
   and `D3DCompile` shims for a shader-model game; that is the nearest
   prior art in the kit for this layer.
5. Only then the hooks: replace the sentinels in `game.toml`.

#### 2026-09-13: listings exported, translation stops at discovery

Kit at `game-dir-wip` (81594e8). `tools/analyze.py` with Ghidra 12.1.3's
default analyzers: 25,768 functions discovered, all 25,768 decompiled, 0
failed, 216 MB of listings in about four minutes. The stub configure links
`build/stub/SpeedRecomp.app` against this config, and the kit's portable
suites pass through the wrappers (56 passed, 3 skipped).

`tools/build.py --regenerate --target gen` parses every listing, then stops
at the translator's discovery gates before emitting any C:

| Gate | Count | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jump-table sites that decoded no entries | 20 | `switch` dispatches whose table the translator's decoder does not recognise in this compiler's output, for example `0x004e9c2d`, `0x006a8a14`, `0x007c488d` |
| jump-table entries with no block entry | 4 of 8 at `0x007f967f` | table slots naming addresses no listing covers |
| literal dispatch targets that are not entry points | 638 | direct calls and jumps whose target no listing owns |

The third gate is the real one; `--allow-table-gaps` only reaches it. Of
the twenty examples the translator prints, nineteen are the fall-through
after a `CALL`: Ghidra ends the function at a call it classifies as
non-returning (`fn_00425178` ends at `CALL 0x007c56b0`), and the translator
emits a jump to the byte after it, which no listing owns. The kit's
translator was tuned on curated listings that carry no such truncations.
Honouring Ghidra's non-returning calls (or re-listing with that analyzer
off) is the next translator change, in the kit; until it lands nothing
compiles and no run report exists. The instruction-level coverage
(unsupported mnemonics) is therefore still unmeasured: the translator gates
on control flow before it emits code.

Order of work from here, all of it in the kit:

1. Translator: non-returning calls and this compiler's jump-table shapes,
   until `--regenerate` emits and compiles the translation.
2. Run report on the stub hosts: which `kernel32`, `user32`, `winmm` and
   `dinput8` calls the boot path makes, and stubs for the network DLLs.
3. Direct3D 9 and the D3DX effect shim, the Metal ports of the 31 effects.
4. Only then the hooks: replace the sentinels in `game.toml` with the frame
   clock, input device and camera addresses the listings name.

## Run log: from a black window to a race (kit be8209f)

Each step below was a separate reason the window stayed black or the game
stopped.

- **MMX.** The video codec (`0x80xxxx`-`0x83xxxx`) uses MMX without asking
  CPUID. The kit now translates MMX; SSE stays a trap.
- **Codec routines.** 68 routines reached only through tables (the dispatch
  table `0x80673d` fills, and the one at `0x801994`) are now entry points in
  `game.toml`.
- **Technique annotations.** The game reads each technique's `shader`
  annotation (`0x006d5c10`). With none, it concludes the fixed-function
  technique is in use and sets device transforms, never `WorldViewProj`, so
  every front-end quad landed at w = 0. Implementing annotations gave the
  first lit frames: the intro movies and the title screen.
- **Preshaders.** Every render state in these effects (`AlphaBlendEnable =
  BlendState[0]`) is a preshader, a copy from a parameter to the output. The
  kit now evaluates them and applies pass states, which fixed the title's
  blending.
- **Never-returning calls.** Ghidra ends a C++ catch funclet's listing on the
  call before its rethrow, so the node allocator's `0x005d1120` was taken as
  never returning, and its return during the race load ended in `R6025 pure
  virtual function call`. A callee whose listing returns is now trusted,
  unless it calls `RaiseException`-like imports or padding follows the call.
- **Shader opcodes.** RSQ is 7 in the kit's shader interpreter (6 is RCP), so
  world shaders no longer fail to load.

`smoke/title-to-menu.script` and `smoke/quick-race.script` drive the headless
host (`build/recomp/pop_smoke`) from boot through the menus into a Quick Play
sprint. The run reaches the race: the car, road, rain and lights draw, the
HUD's timer and speedometer respond, and holding Up accelerates.

Open problems:

- Audio banks (`SOUND/*.abk`) carry x86 code the game relocates into the heap
  and calls (`0x0081f9aa`). The kit had no way to run code outside the image,
  so those calls returned 0. (Fixed later: see the widescreen run log below.)
- The CPU rasterizer is slow in the race, and the long script can hit the
  watchdog. Depth, glare and the in-race HUD still look wrong.
- `GetLastActivePopup` is missing; only the CRT's error path asks for it.

## Run log: Metal, 4K and 120 Hz (kit bc9f7bc)

- **Direct3D 9 on Metal.** Shaders are translated to MSL; textures, surfaces
  and buffers are mirrored on the GPU. Two bugs kept the first GPU frames
  black: the effect state table was off by eight after WRAP7 (index 65,
  POINTSCALE_A = 1.0, landed on COLORWRITEENABLE), and shared effect
  parameters (COLORWRITEMODE, BLENDSTATE) never reached the other effects in
  their pool, so cars, roads and trees wrote no colour.
- **4K.** Render targets render at a scale (RECOMP_D3D9_SCALE; by default at
  least 2160 rows), so the game keeps its 4:3 640x480 logic and the GPU draws
  2880x2160. A race averages about 165 fps there in the headless host.
- **120 Hz.** The engine steps and caps at 1/60 s. mods/core/nfsmw sets
  the simulation rate (default 120): it rewrites the timer's constructor
  argument and fills 0x00a37800, which three redirected readers of the
  pooled 1/60 now read (game.toml operand_redirects).
- **Missing entry.** 0x006a8e70, a vtable method just past a switch's byte
  table, crashed one race type; Ghidra had read it as data.

Open: true 16:9 needs the HUD and field-of-view fixes; the resolution
settings in core.nfsmw exist but stretch the 4:3 layout.

## Run log: widescreen, shadows, occlusion queries, bank code (kit 45219bf)

- **Widescreen.** core.nfsmw ports the ThirteenAG widescreen fix (MIT; see
  NOTICE): hor+ field of view per view, the HUD pushed to the screen edges,
  minimap, FMV and splash fixes. By default the game runs at the screen's
  aspect ratio, capped at 1080 rows.
- **Scale follows the window.** After the drawable has held one size for 15
  frames, the render-target scale is chosen again, so resizing the window or
  going fullscreen changes the render resolution without a device reset.
  Checked in the app: a 1664x1080 game went from 1.00x to 1.38x when the
  window was enlarged.
- **Shadows.** The game samples depth textures as hardware shadow maps: a
  Direct3D 9 driver compares the lookup's z with the stored depth. Those
  stages now use `depth2d` and `sample_compare` (LESSEQUAL, linear). Before
  this, they read a black placeholder, so cars cast no shadow and the car
  bodies showed jagged dark edges.
- **Occlusion queries.** Direct3D 9 occlusion queries count samples on Metal
  through the render pass's visibility-result buffer. `GetData` returns
  S_FALSE until the command buffer that holds the query has finished. The
  game's queries are two-triangle fans at z 0.999 with colour writes off,
  drawn where the sun is. In the Quick Play sprint that point is off screen
  (clip-space y from about -3 to -1.8), so the counts there are 0. On the CPU
  path, a query reports one visible sample.
- **Bank code.** The 386 routines in the 301 `SOUND/*.abk` banks use 20 x86
  instruction forms: `mov`/`add`/`sub`/`imul`/`cmp` on `[esi+d]`, `call`
  into the executable, short `jl`/`jg`, `ret`. `runtime/interp.cpp` runs code
  outside the image that decodes completely up to its `ret`; calls go back
  through `recomp_call`. It is checked against Unicorn on random routines
  (tools/recomp/tests/test_interp_unicorn.py). The race smoke no longer logs
  any unknown call.
- **Speedometer "888".** The digital readout is a backlit LCD: its unlit
  segments are drawn faintly on purpose, as in the original, so "888" behind
  the digits is by design.
- **Headless audio.** The smoke host has no mixer, so a streamed DirectSound
  buffer is re-submitted at each refill there. The app's mixer continues
  streams. `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` with a PCM subformat is now read as PCM
  without a warning.

## Run log: every resolution in the video options

- The Video > Resolution option lists "Auto" (the screen's shape, up to 1080
  rows), then every common size from 640x480 to 7680x4320, plus the screen's
  own size. The original list has six sizes.
- game.toml points the option's tables (supported flags `0x0093dbec`,
  refresh rates `0x009829fc`, label hashes in the switch at `0x0051b7a0`) and
  its wrap-around (`0x0050f970`) at slots from `0x00a37830`, which
  core.nfsmw fills. Data seeds recreate the original six for a run without
  mods.
- Labels: core.nfsmw answers the string lookup `0x0057e920` for the
  `OPT_VO_PC_RES_<W>X<H>` hashes (bStringHash: h = h * 33 + c from ~0).
- The registry value `g_RacingResolution` holds the size packed as
  `0x80000000 | w << 16 | h`, as the widescreen fix stores it. A value the
  original game saved (0-5) loads as Auto. Checked: choosing 6016x3384 and
  accepting reset the device to that size, and the next launch created the
  device at 6016x3384 with that entry selected.
- Whatever size is chosen, the renderer still draws at the window's size
  (never below the game's own), so a size larger than the window is
  supersampled.

## Run log: cinematics, frozen movies, fullscreen, F10

- **Frozen movies.** The movie stream is pumped by a thread waiting on a
  waitable timer (`0x007ec601`, re-armed at absolute FILETIME due times).
  The kit's SetWaitableTimer never fired, so a cinematic stalled once its
  buffer ran dry. The main thread then span in `0x007f7c7e` waiting on the
  `STRM` ring, and because the game runs on the app's main thread, the
  window stopped responding (it could not be brought back with Cmd-Tab).
  Timers now fire.
- **Cropped cinematics.** The widescreen fix's constants scaled the movie
  quad by 4/3 (cropped below 16:9), and the front-end transform scale shrank
  everything else during movies, pulling off-screen elements ("EVENT
  HANDLER", a black box) into view. The quad's corners now come from slots
  (`0x00a37b40`) that core.nfsmw sizes to fit the ~1.68:1 picture inside a
  movie frame. The front end is no longer scaled while a movie plays.
- **Fullscreen.** Entering fullscreen with the green button now becomes the
  Display setting instead of being undone on the next frame.
- **F10.** The mod settings page registers its keys on Direct3D 9 presents,
  which carry no guest pixels.

## Run log: the advanced video options

- Full Screen Anti-Aliasing, Texture Filtering and Shadow Detail were greyed
  out. The game decides from the adapter (`0x006c1510`, `0x006d2100`): shadow
  maps only on NVIDIA (`0x10de`, a D24S8 texture) or ATI, filtering from
  D3DCAPS9.TextureFilterCaps, anti-aliasing from
  CheckDeviceMultiSampleType. The shim reported vendor 0, and its D3DCAPS9 had
  the shader versions at the wrong offsets (172 and 180 instead of 196 and
  204) with everything else zero.
- The shim now describes a GeForce 7800 GTX (0x10de/0x0091) with the caps the
  renderer implements. Texture Filtering and Shadow Detail are offered;
  multisampling is reported unavailable, so anti-aliasing stays off (the
  renderer supersamples by drawing at the window's size instead).
- With vs/ps 3.0 reported, the glossy window effect picks its 3.0 technique,
  so the translator now takes shader model 3: outputs and inputs named by
  their dcl, defi/defb, rep/loop/if/ifc/break/breakc, texldl.
- A shader's own `def` constants past the count the game set were dropped;
  the constant buffer now covers every constant the program reads.
- Shadow Detail at its highest roughly doubles the draw count (shadow-map
  passes): a 720p race went from about 90 fps to about 45 fps headless.

## Run log: the iPad, Linux, Windows and the browser

- **A black main menu on the iPad.** The app found no core mod: a stock
  device loads no plugins, so `core.nfsmw` never ran and the front end drew
  nothing. Core mods are compiled into the app now
  (`cmake/BuiltinMods.cmake`), and the loader resolves a plugin by its stem
  before it opens a file.
- **Black 3D on Linux.** The developer run read its mods and state from the
  Mac build directory beside the shared translation. A run now uses the
  `recomp/` directory next to its own executable (`runtime/layout.cpp`).
  Software rendering (lavapipe) also outran the smoke host's 180-second
  limit, which `RECOMP_SMOKE_SECONDS` now raises.
- **The Windows cross build.** Over llvm-mingw: `dx/d3d.cpp` was missing
  `stdlib.h`, `os_win32.cpp` needed `RRF_SUBKEY_*` fallbacks for the older
  headers, the capture fixture does not build on Win32, `dx_tests` reaches
  `environ` through `__p__environ`, and `mods_tests` links pthread. The
  executable runs the whole script at 100-170 fps under CrossOver.
- **Magenta edges on Vulkan.** The half-pixel correction had the wrong sign,
  so a full-target post-processing pass left its last column and row undrawn
  and they sampled a colour-grading LUT with wrap. Both backends now move
  geometry right and down, as Wine does.
- **20 fps in the browser.** The browser's main thread owns WebGPU, and it
  drained the Direct3D 9 queue once per animation frame; every call that
  answers the game (a query result, a present) waited up to a display frame,
  and the game thread sat in a futex 92% of the time. A hand-over now asks
  the main thread to drain as soon as it is free: a race runs at 115-145 fps.
- **A deadlock in the browser.** The drain was asked for with a proxied call,
  and the main thread runs those wherever it is blocked - here inside the
  WebGPU binding's event lock, waiting on the allocator to free a completed
  event. The drain drew, which took the same lock again. The proxied call now
  only schedules a timeout, which runs from the event loop once nothing of
  ours is part-way through; WebGPU's own callbacks hand their work there too.
- Reading a render target back is not supported in the browser, and the audio
  sink's "starved" count is an artifact: SDL's Emscripten device drains the
  queue on every pull, and no pull arrived late.

## Run log: the merge, the initializers, and the race (kit 30fb57d)

Landing this game's kit work on `main` cost it 27 kernel32 import
declarations. An import with no entry in the table has an unknown argument
count, and `imports_dispatch` then pops only the return address, so every
call to one leaks its arguments. It says so, once per import:

```
KERNEL32.dll!SleepEx has an unknown stdcall argument count: not adjusting
ESP, the guest stack will drift if it is really stdcall
```

A thread polling a waitable timer does that hundreds of thousands of times.
ESP walked ten megabytes below its stack into `.bss` and landed on the
callback table at `0x9bb10c`, so each `call` there pushed a return address
over the table it was about to read, and the addresses it called back were
its own return addresses. The run ended in SEH, refusing a registration
outside the guest stack — four subsystems and several thousand log lines from
the cause.

### The static initializers

The translator reported `0 CRT static initializers from 0 __initterm tables`.
There are 836, in four tables. `007ca540` is textbook `_initterm` — walk the
table, skip nulls, `call [edx]` — but the kit matched the walk by one register
allocation (`CALL EAX`, `ADD ESI,0x4`, a load through `ESI`), and this CRT
keeps its cursor on the stack. So every constructor was called through the
address table, the address table had never heard of them, and the calls
returned 0. The globals reached the game with null vtables: `0x009aa9d0` has
one, and the bitset at `+0x84c` stayed null, so the guest set bits at guest
`0x138` and read them back from the same place — the flat arena made a null
dereference behave like ordinary data.

### The race, and what measures it

A quick-race run completes one or two times in five. The rest hang entering
race loading. The main thread is **running**, not blocked: it spins in
`body_00684710` walking a structure whose `+4` holds 1 where a pointer
belongs, and with the arena returning zeros for the null page the walk never
reaches `_Isnil`. That is why the watchdog reports it as the guest no longer
calling into the runtime, and why `sample <pid>` on the hung process is the
first thing to do — it separates a spin from a wait in thirty seconds.

Measured, so it is not re-litigated: pre-change kit 2 of 5, current kit with
the null check compiled in 0 of 5, compiled out 1 of 5. Indistinguishable at
that sample size. Five runs cannot settle a question about a 20–40% failure,
and this hang was called deterministic twice on two or three runs and was not.

Instruments that move it, and so cannot measure it:

- `RECOMP_WATCH` on the address — 28k hits on a reused stack slot, and the
  run starts completing.
- `RECOMP_NULL_FAULTS` — the run takes its exception path instead and fails
  elsewhere, at an indirect jump with no block entry.
- A conditional breakpoint on the faulting line — evaluated at a line hit
  millions of times, it never arrives.

One correction worth keeping: the structure is a **stack local of the same
thread**, built by three calls immediately before the one that fails
(`0x684b60`, `0x684ae0`, `0x6846a0`). Nothing is racing on that memory. What
varies is upstream of it, in what those calls were given.
